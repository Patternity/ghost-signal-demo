# GhostSignal Demo

This is a browser-based demo of the GhostSignal transport layer.

The demo demonstrates:
- embedding data into a video stream
- exporting the resulting video
- extracting embedded data from the video
- real-time visualization of the decoding process

The demo focuses on the transport layer and does not yet implement
the full GhostSignal data layer defined in the specification.
